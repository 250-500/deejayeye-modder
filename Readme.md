UPDATE: No more NFZ stuff here.

Reasons: 

1.) I don't want people flying in NFZ 

2.) It did not work consistently

If you want to fly in a RED NFZ AND are allowed to AND have problems with them activating your account to do so you should fallback to the firmware parameter change. This was never meant to help people fly in RED NFZ!
